# Pastry Routing

## Project Description

Our final lab assignment in our Networks class was to create a Pastry Routing system with our classmates as nodes for our system. Each classmate had a quantary GUID that served as their node identifier. For more information on the details of the assignment, please see 'Assignment9.pdf' and 'Assignment10.pdf'.

## Project Statistics

When a node requests another node, the number of 'jumps' to reach that node would not exceed 5. For more information on the statistics, please see 'Pastry Router Comparison.pdf'.

## Project Demo

- Download the current directory: _Pastry_
- Install a java runtime on your machine:
- Navigate to the Pastry directory on your machine
- Copy/pasta code into terminal/shell:

```bash
cd src
javac PastryClient.java
java PastryClient
```

## Press enter and watch the magic

Since all of the classmates have shut down their servers, all requests will timeout. However, there is some sample output in 'Assignment10 Sample Output.png'.
